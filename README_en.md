# ContestTrade: A Multi-Agent Trading System Based on an Internal Contest Mechanism

**ContestTrade** is an innovative multi-agent trading framework that introduces a unique internal contest mechanism. By simulating the teamwork and internal competition found in real-world investment firms, it maintains robust decision-making and achieves superior trading performance in dynamic market environments.

## ¬†Introduction

  * **üèÜ Internal Contest Mechanism:** This is the core innovation of the framework. The performance of all agents within the system is continuously scored and ranked. Only the outputs (whether data factors or trading signals) from the top-performing agents are adopted, enabling a merit-based system of elimination and continuous self-optimization.
  * **üë• Two-Tiered Team Framework:** The system features a clear structural design that mimics professional investment firms.
      * **Data Team:** Responsible for processing vast amounts of market data and refining it into a diverse portfolio of high-density textual factors.
      * **Research Team:** Conducts parallel, multi-path deep research based on the effective factors provided by the Data Team to generate final trading decisions.
  * **üõ†Ô∏è Deep Research:** Research agents are equipped with a powerful suite of professional financial tools (such as stock screening, financial data analysis, web search, etc.), allowing them to autonomously plan and execute in-depth analysis, significantly enhancing the quality of trading signals.
  * **üîå Self-Adaptive Resource Allocation:** Through a contest mechanism based on real market feedback, the system adaptively adjusts the resource allocation between the Data and Research teams, effectively improving the overall quality, stability, and reliability of its decisions.

## Framework Overview

</p>

The workflow of ContestTrade operates through a structured two-stage pipeline, simulating the dynamic decision-making process of an investment firm. This dual-contest framework ensures that final decisions are driven only by the most robust and effective insights, maintaining strong adaptability and resilience in complex markets.

1.  **Data Processing Stage:** First, raw market data from multiple sources is fed into the **Data Team**. Multiple Data Analysis Agents work in parallel to refine this raw data into structured "textual factors." At this stage, the internal contest mechanism evaluates the potential value of the factors generated by each data agent and constructs an optimal "factor portfolio."

2.  **Research and Decision-Making Stage:** This optimal factor portfolio is then passed to the **Research Team**. Multiple Research Agents, each with their unique "Trading Beliefs" and access to a powerful set of financial tools, conduct parallel, in-depth analyses of these factors and submit their respective trading proposals. A second round of internal contests then evaluates these proposals, ultimately synthesizing a unified and reliable asset allocation strategy as the final output.
